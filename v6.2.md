With v6.2 being released the other day, I did a bit of a recap to remind myself of what actually
landed this time around for RISC-V. Figured I may as well share it /shrug

With the V2 on the horizon, Cristian Ciocaltea added the VisionFive v1 DT, which has been a long
time coming! Unfortunately, that platform is still not really supported in mainline and may never
get there given it's reliance on non-coherent DMA that is yet to be supported.
He did post some of the out of tree non-coherent dma patches on the list the other day though, and
while that's unlikely to land anytime soon, I hope it gets there eventually :)

Renesas finally joined the RISC-V party for v6.2, with Geert's PR adding the base DT for the
RZ/Five. This platform *also* relies on non-coherent DMA to be fully supported, but that is
currently a work in progress! That work was done by Lab Prabhakar from Renesas.


Palmer's PR is where the actually interesting stuff happens though...
Binglei Wang added support for rethooks, after a rough start with mailer issues!
Drew Jones, while not reviewing, worked on some nice cleanups to alternatives and extension
handling.
Anup got one of his many new-feature support series over the line for PMEM support.
The T-Head c9xx series cores got support for their non-standard PMU variant upstream thanks to
Heiko who has been somewhat of a champion for that platform.
RV32, not to be left out, landed support for dynamic ftrace. That work was carried out by Jamie
Iles, who, as the 32-bit bpf maintainer, clearly has an interest in that part of the arch.
Support for zstd compressed images gained support also, thanks to the work of Jisheng Zhang.
Tong Tiangen extended support for hugepages, Xianting Tian got the remainder of their
VMCOREINFO series over the line & Lui Shixin got HUGE\_VMA{P,LLOC} support enabled.
Jinyu Tang brought in support for updating the tlb & Hal Feng put the finishing touch on the base
support for the VisionFive v1 by added the serial driver for it.
Notable also is a patch from Cleo John, tidying up some styling, as it was their first :)

A whole bunch of others contributed various bits of cleanup and fixes that landed in the v6.2, PR
and for more on those check out the changelog in Palmer's PR:

There were also 4 fixes PRs sent out over the course of the merge window, however none of these
really contained anything particularly significant. A lot of attention recently has been centred
around text patching, so it is no surprise that a number of the fixes are there too, with, out of
the 16 total patches in -fixes, 5 were in this area. Other than that, we had a good few general
correctness bits, for sparse warnings etc
