Round 3 of these "recap" things. I've found them to be both useful and fun to
write - with a couple of months gone by since this stuff actually got merged by
Linus, it is easy to forget it all!

Starting the SoC support side of stuff again, since that's seemingly the
pattern I have set for myself, v6.4 didn't really see all that much in terms of
the SoCs that were already supported. Some minor changes for both the PolarFire
SoC and Allwinner D1 landed, but nothing interesting.
The main change was the addition of support for the StarFive JH7110 & their
first-party VisionFive 2 SBC. Drivers have been merged so far for pinctrl, clk
reset & mmc - enough to boot a basic system to a console.

On the architectural front though, it feels like it has been a busy merge
window. Looking at Palmer's tree before the merge window opened, it looked like
there was more new content in there than we'd had for the last few releases.
Hopefully that's more than a feeling, but rather a "symptom" of having some
more people contributing reviews and patchwork/automated test becoming more
useful.

A change that will be helpful to those who implement their own RISC-V CPUs as a
hobby or learning experience, support was added for 32-bit kernels without an
MMU. In terms of code, there was little to change, but it is yet another niche
combination that is unlikely to be tested much by developers.

A long-running series that was merged in Palmer's first PR for v6.4 was generic
entry support. This means RISC-V now uses the common, cross architecture code
for entering the kernel during syscalls.
TODO: Bjorn, help.
Guo Ren pushed this effort over the line, with Jisheng Zhang contributing some
patches in that series too. Björn Töpel had a hand in things too from a review
point of view, and in fixing things when we discovered systemd was broken after
the series was applied!

Qinglin Pan's Svnapot support series landed too, Svnapot being the ability to
use naturally-aligned-power-of-two page sizes. I don't know of any actual
systems that support this extension, but perhaps Institute of Software Chinese
Academy of Sciences (ISCAS) have something in the works there.

Palmer & his Rivos colleague Evan Green introduced a new "hwprobe" syscall.
This syscall uses key-value pairs to probe for both things like misaligned
access support & what extensions are available on a platform.
"Just use the ISA string" you might say, but unfortunately some backwards
incompatible changes there prevent it from being sufficiently reliable for
use in the userspace API or ABI.

Drew Jones and Alex Ghiti were the most active developers this time around,
with Alex mainly working on "mm" type things & Drew on extension support for
Zicboz and other cleanups.
Alex's 16 changes included support for setting the paging mode from the command
line, for a 64-bit relocatable kernel & a rework of RISC-V's KASAN support.
I *think* the latter should allow the syzkaller fuzzer to start working again
for RISC-V. I hope that it doesn't trigger a deluge of problems!
Drew added support for the aforementioned Zicboz extension. Zicboz is comprised
of a single instruction, used to zero a cacheblock, which Drew has used to add
an optimised routine for clear_page(). Along the way, he contributed a rake of
cleanups for the scaffolding surrounding ISA extensions.

Vector has once again missed the merge window, although this time around it was
tantalisingly close, with some of the Rivos folk theorycrafting a situation,
involving userspace scheduling, where we would have broken userspace
compatibility. The fix should be straightforward, so hopefully it makes it for
v6.5!
