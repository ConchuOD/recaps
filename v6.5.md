FF14 got in the way of writing this as the PRs went out, but I don't think that
enough time has elapsed that I will have forgotten everything that went on.

Again, starting with the SoC support side of things, it again wasn't a big
window for any SoCs that are already supported, just as v6.4 was not either.
I've just sent a PR to Stephen Boyd, the clock maintainer, for the StarFive
JH7110 bits that have been blocking a lot of that support however, so for v6.6
expect to see a lot on the StarFive front! Returning to the present day,
StarFive added watchdog, power management and frequency scaling support for the
JH7110/VisionFive v2.
The main change for v6.5 was the addition of another SoC/board, the T-Head 1520
and the related board, the Lichee Pi 4a. It's super minimal at this point,
barely booting to a login prompt, but it is there!

On the main architectural front, things are a bit more dramatic. After several
years of back and forth, and a bunch of wringing of hands over userspace
interactions, the kernel finally supports the vector extension. There are been
many contributors to that discussion, and quite a few submitters of various
revisions, but it was Andy Chiu who has been working on it of late.
Many thanks to the various contributors and reviewers, from across the
"community" that got it over the line.

The other big change is the addition of ACPI support to the architecture,
courtesy of Ventana's Sunil. It is in a very nascent state, lacking support for
some core peripherals, such as the PLIC, but it is in and hopefully expanded
support is on the horizon.
Support for the Zba & Zbs bitmanip extensions, including in hwprobe, have been
added by Evan Green along with support for tracking ISA extensions across
heterogeneous systems.
Extension detect bits saw a fair bit of rework this cycle, initially gaining
case insensitivity support thanks to Yangyu Chen, followed by cleanup of the
ISA string parsing code to make it more understandable.
Guo Ren, another of the usual suspects here, finally landed independent
irq/softirq stack support, on top of his generic entry support, that landed last
time around in v6.4
dt-binding stuff is appearing here for once, with a bunch of minor cleanups
to allow stricter validation being followed up by a deprecation of the
"riscv,isa" devicetree property. The property has become a bit of a problem,
partly due to imprecise/missing definitions of what extensions actually mean,
and because its ABI predates the ratification of any of the ISA, leading to
differing meanings between the devicetree ABI and the specifications.

Of course there have been many small changes across the board, with some fixes
from Sunil on ACPI, Song Shuai on hibernation (where they have been really
helpful with finding several issues) and others in Palmer's first PR.

The second PR from Palmer mainly contained fixes for the big series merged this
window, with the complexity of the vector series leading to several fixes, some
from Andy himself, as well as fixes and some documentation for ACPI.
Dead Code Data Elimination support was merged in the second PR too, which
purports to make noticeable savings for constrained systems, a joint effort
between Jisheng Zhang & Zhangjin Wu. Zhangjin Wu has a vested interest here, as
they are working on support for RISC-V in nolibc.

Overall, there were probably fewer independent changes merged this window than
others I have written about, but number of individual patches does not appear to
have dropped...
